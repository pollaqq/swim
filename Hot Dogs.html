He was driving home. He couldn't wait to get home. He was hungry. He hadn't eaten in eight hours. 
<p />Eight hours ago he had eaten two hot dogs. The hot dogs were delicious. He had put lots of mustard, onions, and relish on the hot dogs. They were so delicious. 
<p />He got home. He walked upstairs. He walked into his apartment. He opened his refrigerator. He took a package out of the refrigerator. It was a package of hot dogs. 
<p />He took two hot dogs out of the package. He put them into the microwave. He took mustard, onions, and relish out of his refrigerator. 
<p />He grabbed two hot dog buns. He was ready to eat two more delicious hot dogs!
